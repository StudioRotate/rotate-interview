## Git

At Rotate° we use Git Flow as our version control process which you may or may not be familiar with. This involves the creation and usage of  `master`, `develop` and `feature` branches. Today we're just going to use `master` and `feature` branches alongside Pull Requests to manage the submission of you work for review.

- Create your feature branch off the master branch.

    ``` bash
    git checkout -b feature/<your-name>
    ```

- As you work commit your changes to your feature branch with meaningful commit names

- When finished, push your work to the remote origin on github

    ``` bash
    git push orgin feature/<your-name>
    ```

- Finally submit a Pull Request on github by navigating to <https://github.com/StudioRotate/rotate-interview>

## Product 
## Process of development 
- Mobile first
  During the interview session I began developing the Mobile version of the page, so began by introducing the core elements of the page, and had the hero, logo, cart and account icons introduced on the page. I also included the main text. The formatting wasn't right when I left it, and I still didn't have the menu icon or 'Pick yours' button on the page. I learnt about flexbox, and much more about CSS styling. 
  I spent some time researching more about CSS but came to realise the best process of learning would happen if I tried to learn as I went, specifying my research to the project at hand.

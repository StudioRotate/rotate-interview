## Process of development 
- Mobile first
  During the interview session I began developing the Mobile version of the page, so began by introducing the core elements of the page, and had the hero, logo, cart and account icons introduced on the page. I also included the main text. The formatting wasn't right when I left it, and I still didn't have the menu icon or 'Pick yours' button on the page. I learnt about flexbox, and much more about CSS styling. 
  I spent some time researching more about CSS but came to realise the best process of learning would happen if I tried to learn as I went, specifying my research to the project at hand. 
  A lot of this was new to me, so a good amount of time was spent on understanding a concept which was then much quicker to apply to multiple other elements. 
  
  
## Time spent, and what I would do with more 
- I wasn't able to spend as much time on this as I would have liked. But I did my best to make use of the time I had, and would estimate that overall this is the result of one full day of work, though it was spread over sunday and thursday afternoon primarily. 
- This meant I wasn't able to complete every element required, or that I wanted to finish so with more time I would:
  - Style the menu slideout, currently it is just a simple list and isn't responsive. 
  - I would refactor my code to make it cleanear and more legible, perhaps extracting the menu into a seperate file. 
  - One thing I found difficult was have consistent spacing between elements whilst being responsive, I would work on this and make sure the proportions are much more exact. 
  - I would also look into more of what vue can do in development, as I spent the majority of my time focused on the CSS. 
  
## What I learnt
This is certainly the most in depth work in CSS I have done so far, I feel like this challenge has allowed me to build a better grounding with certain elements, and I am much more comfortable with the basics now. This is also the first time I have done responsive design, which has been really great to learn more about. 
Sketch has been really fun to work with, especially how great svg files are.
